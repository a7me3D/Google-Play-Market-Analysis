## Overview

This project is an integral component of my Data Science Associate preparation program at Datacamp. I invite you to explore my Datacamp portfolio for further insights and information.

Mobile applications have become an integral part of our daily lives. With the potential for creating lucrative apps and the ease of development, there is a continuous surge in the number of apps being developed. In this notebook, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps available on Google Play Store across various categories.

The primary objective of this analysis is to extract valuable insights from the data, which will guide us in devising strategies to drive growth and enhance user retention. We will explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and potentially build predictive models to achieve our project goals.

Feel free to explore the insights and recommendations provided in this notebook. For further details on the Data Science Associate Preparation Program and to check my Datacamp portfolio, please refer to the links below.
